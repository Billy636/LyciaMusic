In the application’s sidebar, when I click the plus (+) button to create a new playlist, a prompt appears with the text:
“localhost:1420 says: Please enter the name of the new playlist.”
The style of this prompt also looks bad. Please create a modern, trend-aligned confirmation dialog that matches the overall style of the application—especially considering that many users choose the “follow the album artwork” theme.

Second, there is a small bug in the application:
When I right-click a song in the song list and choose “Add to Playlist”, a dialog appears allowing me to select an existing playlist or create a new one. The problem is that, in this dialog, the playlists we previously created do not display cover images. Instead, their covers appear as broken image placeholders, which indicates that the cover images are not being loaded correctly. Please fix this issue.

Important notes:

While making these changes, please ensure that none of the existing features stop working.

Do not make any single file excessively long. Use a refactoring-oriented approach so that the codebase remains clean, modular, and easy to manage and read.
