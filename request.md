On the Folders page, there is currently no way to select multiple folders for deletion. Users can only delete folders by right-clicking a single folder and choosing “Delete Folder.”
Please design a method that allows batch deletion of folders, and make sure it matches the overall style of the application.

In addition, when a folder is positioned near the bottom of the list, part of the right-click context menu extends beyond the application window and becomes hidden, making those options impossible to click. Please resolve this issue as well.

Important notes:

While making these changes, please ensure that none of the existing features stop working.

Do not make any single file excessively long. Use a refactoring-oriented approach so that the codebase remains clean, modular, and easy to manage and read.
