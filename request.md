In the previous changes, you successfully made the artist and album covers on my Favorites page display correctly. However, I noticed that the images appear to be compressed. For larger images, users can immediately tell whether they are blurry, so maintaining image clarity is very important. I would like the large circular artist images and the square album images to appear sharper and clearer.

Finally, I would like to ask whether this approach will affect performance. Is it related to the number of songs?
Would having 3,000 songs cause lag? What about 5,000? Or 10,000?
Of course, a typical user usually has only a few thousand songs, not tens of thousands.

Important notes:

While making these changes, please ensure that none of the existing features stop working.

Do not make any single file excessively long. Use a refactoring-oriented approach so that the codebase remains clean, modular, and easy to manage and read.
